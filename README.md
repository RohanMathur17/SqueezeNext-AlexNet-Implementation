## What is SqueezeNet?

SqueezeNet is an algorithm that is designed to be small, yet highly accurate. In 2016, researchers from DeepScale (a startup company later acquired by Tesla), UC Berkeley, and Stanford University proposed this compact and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN)[1]. The main goal of SqueezeNet is to strike a balance between high accuracy and low complexity, making it an ideal choice for devices with limited resources like mobiles and embedded systems.
